Penjing (pinyin for 盆景) is the Chinese name describing the garderning art that lead to the Japanese Bonsai.

*Suffix Trees*  are like Bonsais, they come in many shapes but they always aim to be compact. This library however aims to be broader than just providing the trees. It tries to expose all the landscaping that comes with them: useful algorithms.

As this little introduction implies, this headers only library implements suffix tree construction and related algorithms using C++20.
